Given a description of libraries and books available, plan which books to scan from
which library to maximize the total score of all scanned books, taking into account that
each library needs to be signed up before it can ship books.

*  Many libraries can have a copy of the same book, but we only need to scan each book once

* Only one library at a time can be going through this process

* The libraries can be signed up in any order.

* Each library must be described only once.
Note that:
● You don’t need to scan all books from a library you describe.
● If a library signup process nishes aer D days, its description will be ignored.
● Books shipped aer D days will be ignored.
